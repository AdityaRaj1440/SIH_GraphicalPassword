new SimpleImage(filename) 	creates a SimpleImage to represent the image in filename 	new SimpleImage("devil.png") is
new SimpleImage(width, height) 	creates a SimpleImage whose dimensions are width by height. All the pixels in this image are black (0, 0, 0, 255) 	new SimpleImage(100, 100) is
new SimpleImage(fileInputElement) 	creates a SimpleImage to represent the image selected by the user using the fileInputElement given from the web page 	var input = document.getElementById("fileLoader");
var img = new SimpleImage(input); is

assuming the user selected that image from their computer.
getWidth() 	returns the image's width, or number of pixels in the X direction 	logo.getWidth() is 100
getHeight() 	returns the image's height, or number of pixels in the Y direction 	logo.getHeight() is 85
getPixel(x,y) 	returns the pixel in this image at the coordinate (x, y) 	logo.getPixel(0, 0) is the pixel (255, 255, 255, 255)
setPixel(x,y,pixel) 	copies the RGBA values from the given pixel into pixel at the (x,y) coordinates given 	logo.setPixel(50, 42, pix2) changes the color to white
setSize(width, height) 	resizes the image to be width by height. The image is scaled to fit into the new dimensions. 	logo.setSize(300, 85) is
values() 	returns all the pixels in the image, starting in the upper-left corner and moving down to the lower-right corner, providing a way to access each pixel in turn 	

for (var pixel of logo.values()) {

// modify pixel

}
