Concerns regarding implementation: 
1. How to maintain image variation for recognizability?
2. How to reduce time for logging in?
3. How to increase accessibility for disabled users/maintain simplicity?

What we need to do:
1. generate routes for navigation 
2. shuffle hardcoded array for randomized display
3. keep a state of selected images (image onselect & highlight)
4. redirect to grid image once a given number of images (5) have been selected
5. arrange the 5 images in correct order (drag/drop functionality)
6. generate randomized images for selection

Dependencies:
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install react-router-dom@6
